SmallMusicList
==============

##For iOS 8  

iOS' Music app, since iOS 7, has terribly huge cover art for some lists. They're wasting a lot of space, and make the list annoying to browse. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus made this less of an issue, but it's still one.  

This tweak reduces the cover art size wherever possible. It's quickly done, so there is still a lot of padding left, and things don't look as good as they could.  
But heh, enjoy !
